# pumpkin-launching-sim
Virtual Pumpkin Launching Simulation in Python

Created 10/29/2020

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Download the repo and then run ```python main.py```. You may need to run ```pip install pygame``` beforehand if you don't have the pygame package.

The project has also been deployed here: https://repl.it/@BoreMore/pumpkin-launching-sim, but the screen aspect ratio can't be changed on repl.it. For the best experience, download and run it locally using the above instructions.
